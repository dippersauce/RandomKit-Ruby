# RandomKit-Ruby
Simple Pseudo Random Number Generation in pure Ruby.

# Features 
RandomKit currently provides randomness from the following sources:

* MT199937
* OpenSSL via DeviceRandom
* ARC4Random

More PRNGs will be added in the future, as well as methods to scramble Hashes and Array using output from the PRNGs.

## Usage
Just place ```require 'RandomKit'``` in the head of your Ruby file, then call as you would any class method.
The PRNGs can be supplied with a seed to force deterministic output, calls without a supplied seed deault to a random seed generated by DeviceRandom.

```randomInt32 = RandomKit.ARC4Random(123456789)```
```randomInt32 = RandomKit.M199937()```
